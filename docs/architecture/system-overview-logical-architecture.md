# System Overview (Logical Architecture)
The system is composed of several high-level logical blocks that work together to execute the trading lifecycle.

API Connectors: The gateway to the external world. Manages all communication with the Robinhood API (both WebSocket for real-time data and REST for orders).

Data Layer: Responsible for ingesting, storing, and providing market data. It writes to and reads from a local SQLite database.

Strategy Engine: The brain of the system. It consumes market data, applies technical indicators, and generates trading signals based on the logic of the loaded strategy (e.g., S1).

Execution Engine: Acts on signals from the Strategy Engine. It constructs and places orders, manages their lifecycle (e.g., NEW â†’ FILLED), and emulates complex order types like brackets.

Risk Management: A critical service that is queried by the Strategy Engine before placing any trade. It enforces rules like position sizing and global loss limits.

Indicator Library: A collection of reusable technical analysis functions (VWAP, EMA, ATR, etc.).
