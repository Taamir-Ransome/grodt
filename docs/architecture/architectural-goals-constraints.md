# Architectural Goals & Constraints
The architecture is designed to meet the following key objectives:

Modularity: Components are decoupled, allowing for independent development, testing, and replacement. A new strategy or API connector can be added with minimal impact on the rest of the system.

Performance: The system must handle real-time market data and execute orders with low latency to minimize slippage.

Reliability: The system must be resilient to failures, including API disconnects and unexpected errors. It incorporates features like kill switches and robust error handling.

Testability: The architecture supports comprehensive testing, from unit tests of individual components to end-to-end backtesting and paper trading validation.

Scalability: While the initial deployment is a single node, the containerized design allows for future scaling of individual components.
