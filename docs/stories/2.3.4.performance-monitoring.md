## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From stories 2.3.1 (Prometheus Metrics Collection), 2.3.2 (Grafana Dashboard Creation), and 2.3.3 (Alerting System), the monitoring infrastructure is fully established. This story adds comprehensive performance monitoring to ensure the trading system operates optimally and identifies performance issues before they impact trading operations.

### Data Models
**Performance Metrics:**
- System resource metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application performance metrics (response times, throughput)
- Database performance metrics (query times, connection usage)
- Trading operation performance metrics (order processing time, signal generation time)

### API Specifications
**Performance Monitoring Endpoints:**
- `GET /performance/metrics` - Current performance metrics
- `GET /performance/trends` - Historical performance trends
- `GET /performance/bottlenecks` - Identified performance bottlenecks
- `GET /performance/reports` - Generated performance reports

### Component Specifications
**Performance Monitoring Components:**
- System resource monitor for CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- Application performance profiler for code-level performance analysis
- Database performance monitor for SQLite query optimization
- Performance trend analyzer for historical performance tracking
- Performance report generator for analysis and recommendations

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#monitoring]:
- Performance monitoring: `grodtd/monitoring/performance_monitor.py`
- System metrics: `grodtd/monitoring/system_metrics.py`
- Performance analysis: `grodtd/monitoring/performance_analyzer.py`
- Performance configuration: `configs/performance.yaml`

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location:** `tests/integration/test_monitoring/test_performance/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#test-organization]

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for performance metrics collection and analysis
- Integration tests for performance monitoring system
- Performance tests for monitoring system overhead
- Test coverage: >85% for new performance monitoring code [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#test-coverage-requirements]

**Testing Frameworks:**
- pytest for unit and integration tests
- Performance testing with load simulation
- Benchmark testing for monitoring system overhead
- Stress testing for performance under load

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Impact:** Monitoring system must have minimal performance overhead (< 1ms) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#performance-requirements]
**Resource Usage:** Performance monitoring should not exceed 5% of system resources [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]
**Integration Requirements:** Must integrate with existing Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards [Source: architecture/monitoring-observability.md]
**Logging Standards:** Structured JSON logging with structlog [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#structured-logging]

### Project Structure Notes
The performance monitoring system extends the existing monitoring infrastructure:
- Builds on Prometheus metrics collection from story 2.3.1
- Integrates with Grafana dashboards from story 2.3.2
- Uses alerting system from story 2.3.3 for performance alerts
- Adds new performance-specific monitoring components

## Testing

### Test File Location
`tests/integration/test_monitoring/test_performance/` - Integration tests for performance monitoring

### Test Standards
- **Unit Tests**: Test performance metrics collection, analysis, and reporting
- **Integration Tests**: Test performance monitoring system integration
- **Performance Tests**: Test monitoring system performance overhead
- **Coverage**: >85% for new performance monitoring code

### Testing Frameworks
- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **Performance testing**: Load simulation and benchmark testing
- **Stress testing**: Performance under high load conditions
- **Monitoring overhead**: Test monitoring system resource usage

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Performance metrics are collected accurately and efficiently
- Performance bottlenecks are correctly identified and reported
- Performance trends are tracked and analyzed properly
- Performance alerts are triggered for degradation
- Performance reports are generated with accurate data
- Monitoring system overhead is minimal (< 1ms, < 5% resources)
