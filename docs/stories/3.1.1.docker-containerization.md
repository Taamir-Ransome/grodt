## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 2.3.2 (Grafana Dashboard Creation), the monitoring infrastructure is already containerized with Prometheus and Grafana. The GRODT application needs to be properly containerized to integrate with this existing monitoring stack.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - focuses on containerization infrastructure.

### API Specifications
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health` - returns application status
- Metrics endpoint: `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics (already implemented)
- Application port: 8000 (web interface)
- Metrics port: 9090 (Prometheus scraping)

### Component Specifications
**Docker Configuration:**
- Base image: `python:3.12-slim` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#docker-base-images]
- Multi-stage build process for optimization
- Non-root user execution for security
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Structured logging with structlog

**File Locations:**
- Dockerfile: `docker/Dockerfile` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#docker-structure]
- Docker Compose: `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Application entry: `grodtd/app.py`
- Web interface: `grodtd/web_app.py`

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#docker-structure]:
- Main Dockerfile: `docker/Dockerfile`
- Docker Compose: `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Application code: `grodtd/` directory
- Configuration: `configs/` directory
- Data persistence: `data/` directory

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location:** `tests/integration/test_docker/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#test-organization]

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for Docker configuration validation
- Integration tests for container orchestration
- Security testing for container vulnerabilities
- Performance testing for container resource usage
- Test coverage: >85% for new containerization code [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#test-coverage-requirements]

**Testing Frameworks:**
- pytest for unit and integration tests
- Docker testing with testcontainers or similar
- Security scanning with tools like Trivy or Snyk
- Performance testing with container resource monitoring

### Technical Constraints
**Python Version:** Python 3.12+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#python-version]
**Docker Standards:** Multi-stage builds, non-root user, health checks [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#dockerfile-standards]
**Security:** No hardcoded secrets, proper user permissions, vulnerability scanning [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
**Logging:** Structured JSON logging with structlog [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#structured-logging]

### Project Structure Notes
The current Docker setup exists but needs optimization:
- Current Dockerfile uses Python 3.11, needs upgrade to 3.12+
- Missing multi-stage build optimization
- No non-root user implementation
- Health checks not properly configured
- Docker Compose needs updates for proper orchestration

## Testing

### Test File Location

### Test Standards
- **Unit Tests**: Test Docker configuration validation and health check endpoints
- **Integration Tests**: Test container orchestration with Docker Compose
