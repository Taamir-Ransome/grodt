# Story 3.1.1: Docker Containerization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As the system operator, I need the GRODT application to be containerized using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across development, staging, and production environments.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GRODT application runs in Docker containers with all dependencies
2. Container images are optimized for size and security
3. Multi-stage builds minimize image size and attack surface
4. Non-root user execution for security compliance
5. Health checks and readiness probes are implemented
6. Container logs are properly structured and accessible

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Update Dockerfile with multi-stage build process (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Update base image to Python 3.12+ as per tech stack requirements
  - [ ] Implement multi-stage build to separate build and runtime environments
  - [ ] Optimize layer caching for dependencies
  - [ ] Add security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Task 2: Implement security best practices (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create non-root user for container execution
  - [ ] Remove unnecessary packages and dependencies
  - [ ] Implement proper file permissions
  - [ ] Add security headers and configurations
- [ ] Task 3: Add health checks and monitoring (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement health check endpoint in application
  - [ ] Add Docker HEALTHCHECK instruction
  - [ ] Configure readiness probes
  - [ ] Add proper logging configuration for containerized environment
- [ ] Task 4: Optimize container configuration (AC: 1, 6)
  - [ ] Update Docker Compose orchestration
  - [ ] Configure proper volume management
  - [ ] Set up environment variable management
  - [ ] Implement structured logging with structlog
- [ ] Task 5: Update documentation and testing (AC: All)
  - [ ] Update deployment documentation
  - [ ] Add container testing to CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Create container security testing
  - [ ] Update development environment setup

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 2.3.2 (Grafana Dashboard Creation), the monitoring infrastructure is already containerized with Prometheus and Grafana. The GRODT application needs to be properly containerized to integrate with this existing monitoring stack.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - focuses on containerization infrastructure.

### API Specifications
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health` - returns application status
- Metrics endpoint: `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics (already implemented)
- Application port: 8000 (web interface)
- Metrics port: 9090 (Prometheus scraping)

### Component Specifications
**Docker Configuration:**
- Base image: `python:3.12-slim` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#docker-base-images]
- Multi-stage build process for optimization
- Non-root user execution for security
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Structured logging with structlog

**File Locations:**
- Dockerfile: `docker/Dockerfile` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#docker-structure]
- Docker Compose: `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Application entry: `grodtd/app.py`
- Web interface: `grodtd/web_app.py`

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#docker-structure]:
- Main Dockerfile: `docker/Dockerfile`
- Docker Compose: `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Application code: `grodtd/` directory
- Configuration: `configs/` directory
- Data persistence: `data/` directory

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location:** `tests/integration/test_docker/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#test-organization]

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for Docker configuration validation
- Integration tests for container orchestration
- Security testing for container vulnerabilities
- Performance testing for container resource usage
- Test coverage: >85% for new containerization code [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#test-coverage-requirements]

**Testing Frameworks:**
- pytest for unit and integration tests
- Docker testing with testcontainers or similar
- Security scanning with tools like Trivy or Snyk
- Performance testing with container resource monitoring

### Technical Constraints
**Python Version:** Python 3.12+ [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#python-version]
**Docker Standards:** Multi-stage builds, non-root user, health checks [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#dockerfile-standards]
**Security:** No hardcoded secrets, proper user permissions, vulnerability scanning [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
**Logging:** Structured JSON logging with structlog [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#structured-logging]

### Project Structure Notes
The current Docker setup exists but needs optimization:
- Current Dockerfile uses Python 3.11, needs upgrade to 3.12+
- Missing multi-stage build optimization
- No non-root user implementation
- Health checks not properly configured
- Docker Compose needs updates for proper orchestration

## Testing

### Test File Location
`tests/integration/test_docker/` - Integration tests for Docker containerization

### Test Standards
- **Unit Tests**: Test Docker configuration validation and health check endpoints
- **Integration Tests**: Test container orchestration with Docker Compose
- **Security Tests**: Container vulnerability scanning and security compliance
- **Performance Tests**: Container resource usage and startup time
- **Coverage**: >85% for new containerization code

### Testing Frameworks
- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **testcontainers**: Docker container testing
- **Trivy/Snyk**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Docker Bench**: Security best practices validation

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Container builds successfully with multi-stage process
- Non-root user execution works properly
- Health checks respond correctly
- Container logs are structured and accessible
- Security scanning passes without high-severity vulnerabilities
- Performance meets requirements (startup time < 30 seconds)
