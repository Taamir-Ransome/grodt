# Story 1.1: Trend Identification

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** trading strategy,
**I want** to calculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and a short-term Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for BTC and ETH on a 1-minute timeframe,
**so that** I can identify trend direction for automated trading decisions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system correctly fetches 1-minute OHLCV data.
2. VWAP is calculated and updated with each new bar.
3. A configurable short-term EMA (e.g., 9-period) is calculated and updated.
4. A trend is considered "up" when the price is above both VWAP and EMA.
5. A trend is considered "down" when the price is below both VWAP and EMA.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, so no previous story context exists.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#database-schema]
- The system uses SQLite database with tables: trades, orders, positions, equity_curve
- OHLCV data will be processed into 1-minute bars and stored for indicator calculations
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs for OHLCV data storage schema

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/system-overview-logical-architecture.md#api-connectors]
- API Connectors manage communication with Robinhood API (WebSocket for real-time data, REST for orders)
- Real-time data flow: WebSocket Connector streams quotes and trades -> Data Layer processes into 1-minute OHLCV bars
- Historical data flow: HTTP Connector fetches historical data on startup -> Data Layer backfills SQLite database

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/component-deep-dive.md#strategy-interface]
- Strategy Interface: A base class that defines required methods for any new strategy (e.g., on_bar(bar_data), on_fill(fill_data))
- Indicator Library: A collection of reusable technical analysis functions (VWAP, EMA, ATR, etc.)
- The S1 strategy will be the first implementation of the Strategy Interface

### File Locations
Based on project structure analysis:
- Indicator Library: `grodtd/features/indicators.py` (existing file)
- Strategy Engine: `grodtd/strategies/` directory
- Data Layer: `grodtd/storage/data_loader.py` (existing file)
- API Connectors: `grodtd/connectors/` directory

### Testing Requirements
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for testing standards, frameworks, or patterns.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md]
- Performance: System must handle real-time market data with low latency
- Reliability: System must be resilient to failures including API disconnects
- Testability: Architecture supports comprehensive testing from unit tests to end-to-end validation
- Modularity: Components are decoupled allowing independent development and testing

### Project Structure Notes
The current project structure aligns with the architecture:
- `grodtd/features/indicators.py` exists for indicator library
- `grodtd/connectors/` exists for API connectors
- `grodtd/storage/` exists for data layer
- `grodtd/strategies/` exists for strategy implementations

## Testing
No specific testing standards found in architecture documents. Standard Python testing practices should be followed with unit tests in the `tests/` directory.
