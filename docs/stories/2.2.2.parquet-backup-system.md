## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2.1 (Historical Data Pipeline):
- Enhanced data loader with Parquet optimization (compression, partitioning) is already implemented
- Comprehensive data validation with outlier detection and gap analysis is available
- Incremental update system for data fetching is working
- Flexible data query interface with export capabilities is functional
- All test cases passing (14/14) with 100% success rate
- Robinhood API integration is complete for live trading

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#database-schema]
- **trades**: Records every filled trade (id, timestamp, symbol, side, price, quantity)
- **orders**: Tracks the lifecycle of every order (id, client_order_id, status, symbol, quantity, submit_timestamp, fill_timestamp)
- **positions**: Maintains the current portfolio positions (symbol, quantity, average_entry_price)
- **equity_curve**: Stores a timeseries of portfolio value for performance tracking (timestamp, portfolio_value)

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#data-backup]
- Scheduled nightly job reads the SQLite database
- Converts main tables to Parquet format
- Saves to backup location with compression and column-oriented storage
- Backup provides compressed, column-oriented backup suitable for analytics

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/system-overview-logical-architecture.md]
- **Data Layer**: Responsible for ingesting, storing, and providing market data. Writes to and reads from local SQLite database
- **Storage Components**: Current storage implementation in `grodtd/storage/` includes data_loader.py and interfaces.py
- **Backup Integration**: Backup system should integrate with existing data layer components

### File Locations
Based on current project structure:
- **Backup Manager**: `grodtd/storage/backup_manager.py` (new file to create)
- **Backup Configuration**: `configs/backup.yaml` (new file to create)
- **Backup Storage**: `data/backups/` (new directory to create)
- **Backup Tests**: `tests/unit/test_backup_manager.py` (new file to create)
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/test_backup_system.py` (new file to create)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md]
- **Reliability**: System must be resilient to failures, including API disconnects and unexpected errors
- **Performance**: System must handle real-time market data and execute orders with low latency
- **Testability**: Architecture supports comprehensive testing, from unit tests to end-to-end validation
- **Modularity**: Components are decoupled, allowing for independent development, testing, and replacement

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md#testability]
- Comprehensive testing from unit tests of individual components to end-to-end validation
- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_backup_manager.py` and `tests/integration/test_backup_system.py`
- Testing frameworks: pytest (existing project standard)
- Test patterns: Unit tests for individual components, integration tests for backup/restore workflows
- Specific testing requirements:
  - Backup integrity verification testing
  - Restoration process testing with different backup versions
  - Performance testing for large dataset backups
  - Failure condition testing

### Project Structure Notes
- Current storage implementation in `grodtd/storage/` provides data loading and interfaces
- Backup system should extend existing storage architecture
- Docker volume for SQLite DB ensures data persistence across container restarts
- Backup system should work with existing Docker deployment architecture

## Testing
- **Test File Location**: `tests/unit/test_backup_manager.py` and `tests/integration/test_backup_system.py`
- **Test Standards**: pytest framework with comprehensive coverage
- **Testing Frameworks**: pytest (existing project standard)
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit tests for backup manager components
  - Integration tests for backup and restoration workflows
  - Backup integrity verification testing
  - Performance testing for large dataset backups
  - Failure condition testing and error handling
  - Retention policy testing and cleanup validation
