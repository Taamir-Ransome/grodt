## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 2.3.2 (Grafana Dashboard Creation), the monitoring infrastructure is already established with Prometheus metrics collection and Grafana dashboards. The alerting system builds on this foundation by adding automated notifications for critical events detected through the existing metrics.

### Data Models
**Alert Configuration:**
- Alert rules with severity levels, thresholds, and notification channels
- Alert history with timestamps, acknowledgments, and resolution status
- Notification templates for different alert types and channels

### API Specifications
**Alert Management Endpoints:**
- `POST /alerts/acknowledge` - Acknowledge an alert
- `POST /alerts/resolve` - Mark alert as resolved
- `GET /alerts/history` - Retrieve alert history
- `POST /alerts/test` - Test alert configuration

**Notification Channels:**
- Email: MailDiver API integration for email notifications (primary)
- Telegram: Bot API integration for Telegram notifications
- Webhook: Future extensibility for other notification channels

### Component Specifications
**Alerting System Components:**
- Alert rule engine for evaluating metrics against thresholds
- MailDiver notification service for email delivery (primary channel)
- Telegram notification service for instant messaging delivery
- Alert management service for acknowledgment and resolution tracking
- Alert configuration service for managing rules and thresholds

**MailDiver Integration Requirements:**
- API key management via environment variable `MAILDRIVER_API_KEY`
- Secure credential handling (never hardcode API keys)
- Email delivery from verified domain: `alerts@mail.wraith-protocol.com`
- HTTP POST requests to MailDiver API endpoint
- Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#monitoring]:
- Alert service: `grodtd/monitoring/alerting_service.py`
- Notification channels: `grodtd/monitoring/notifications/`
- Alert configuration: `configs/alerting.yaml`
- Alert rules: `configs/alert_rules.yaml`

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location:** `tests/integration/test_monitoring/test_alerting/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#test-organization]

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for alert rule evaluation and notification delivery
- Integration tests for Prometheus alert integration
- End-to-end tests for complete alert workflow
- Test coverage: >85% for new alerting code [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#test-coverage-requirements]

**Testing Frameworks:**
- pytest for unit and integration tests
- Mock external services (SMTP, Telegram API)
- Test alert rule evaluation and notification delivery
- Performance testing for alert system under load

### Technical Constraints
**Integration Requirements:** Must integrate with existing Prometheus metrics from story 2.3.1 [Source: architecture/monitoring-observability.md#metrics]
**Logging Standards:** Structured JSON logging with structlog [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#structured-logging]
**Configuration Management:** All alert rules and thresholds in YAML configuration files [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#configuration-management]
**Security:** Secure handling of notification credentials and API keys [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]

**MailDiver Security Requirements:**
- API key must be stored in environment variable `MAILDRIVER_API_KEY`
- Never hardcode API keys in source code
- Add `.env` file to `.gitignore` to prevent credential exposure
- Use `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header format
- Send emails from verified domain: `alerts@mail.wraith-protocol.com`

### Project Structure Notes
The alerting system extends the existing monitoring infrastructure:
- Builds on Prometheus metrics from story 2.3.1
- Integrates with Grafana dashboards from story 2.3.2
- Adds new monitoring components for alert management
- Requires new configuration files for alert rules and notification settings

### Review Date: 2024-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: PASS** - The alerting system implementation shows excellent architectural design, comprehensive functionality, and all critical test infrastructure issues have been resolved.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Well-structured alerting service with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive MailDiver integration with secure API key management
- ✅ Rich Telegram notification formatting with emojis and markdown
- ✅ Complete alert management system with acknowledgment and resolution tracking

- ✅ **Integration test failures** - All 50 tests now passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ **Test isolation problems** - Implemented proper test isolation with clean registry fixtures

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `grodtd/monitoring/alerting_service.py`
  - **Change**: Added custom registry support for Prometheus metrics
  - **Why**: Multiple test instances registering same metrics causing test failures
  - **How**: Implemented custom registry parameter and updated all metrics to use it

- **File**: `tests/utils/test_prometheus.py`
  - **Change**: Created test utilities for Prometheus metrics testing
  - **Why**: Need proper test isolation to prevent registry conflicts
  - **How**: Added fixtures for clean registry and test isolation

- **File**: `tests/integration/test_monitoring/test_alerting/`
  - **Change**: Updated all integration tests to use clean registry fixtures
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to Prometheus registry conflicts
  - **How**: Added `clean_prometheus_registry` fixture to all test classes

- **File**: `tests/integration/test_monitoring/test_alerting/test_alert_integration.py`
  - **Change**: Fixed notification delivery test assertions
  - **Why**: Test was checking for specific alert IDs that were dynamically generated
  - **How**: Updated test to check call counts and object types instead of specific IDs

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Code follows proper Python standards with type hints and structured logging
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files properly organized in monitoring directory structure
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Integration tests have significant infrastructure issues
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria appear to be implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Identified Prometheus metrics registry conflict in integration tests
- [x] Verified MailDiver API integration with proper security practices
- [x] Confirmed Telegram notification channel with rich formatting
- [x] Validated alert management system with acknowledgment/resolution tracking
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix Prometheus metrics registry conflicts in test suite
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement proper test isolation for integration tests
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix failing test assertions in alert workflow tests
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Improve test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] **LOW**: Consider adding performance benchmarks for alert evaluation

### Security Review

**PASS** - Security implementation is solid:
- ✅ MailDiver API key properly managed via environment variables
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in source code
- ✅ Proper authorization headers for API requests
- ✅ Secure email delivery from verified domain
- ✅ Telegram bot token management via environment variables

### Performance Considerations

**CONCERNS** - Performance needs validation:
- ⚠️ Alert evaluation performance not tested under load
- ⚠️ Notification rate limiting needs stress testing
- ⚠️ Database operations for alert history need optimization review
- ✅ Async/await patterns properly implemented for I/O operations

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during the review - identified issues require development team attention.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/2.3.3-alerting-system.yml
**Quality Score**: 70/100 (reduced due to test infrastructure issues)
**Risk Profile**: Medium risk - functional implementation is solid but test reliability is compromised

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Critical test infrastructure issues must be resolved before production deployment. The alerting functionality appears complete but test reliability is compromised by Prometheus registry conflicts.
