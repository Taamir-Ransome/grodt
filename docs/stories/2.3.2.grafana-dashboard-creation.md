## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3.1 (Prometheus Metrics Collection), the system now has:
- Comprehensive metrics collection system with `/metrics` endpoint
- Trading metrics (PnL, drawdown, hit rate, Sharpe ratio) with real-time updates
- System metrics (API latency, memory, CPU, disk, database performance)
- Business metrics (regime accuracy, strategy performance, feature store, risk management)
- Prometheus client integration ready for Grafana visualization
- All metrics properly labeled and categorized for dashboard consumption

### Data Models
**Metrics Data Structure** [Source: architecture/monitoring-observability.md]:
- Metrics exposed on `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- Structured JSON logging format with contextual information (strategy_name, order_id)
- Real-time visualization support for PnL curves, open positions, operational metrics

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/data-architecture.md]:
- `trades` table: Records every filled trade (id, timestamp, symbol, side, price, quantity)
- `orders` table: Tracks order lifecycle (id, client_order_id, status, symbol, quantity, submit_timestamp, fill_timestamp)
- `positions` table: Current portfolio positions (symbol, quantity, average_entry_price)
- `equity_curve` table: Portfolio value timeseries (timestamp, portfolio_value)

### API Specifications
**Metrics Endpoint** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]:
- `/metrics` endpoint exposed by Trading Bot App
- Prometheus scrapes this endpoint for time-series data collection
- Integration with Grafana for visualization and dashboard creation

**System Architecture** [Source: architecture/system-overview-logical-architecture.md]:
- API Connectors: Gateway to external world, manages Robinhood API communication
- Data Layer: Ingests, stores, and provides market data via SQLite database
- Strategy Engine: Consumes market data, applies technical indicators, generates signals
- Execution Engine: Acts on signals, constructs orders, manages order lifecycle
- Risk Management: Enforces rules like position sizing and global loss limits

### Component Specifications
**Monitoring Components** [Source: architecture/monitoring-observability.md]:
- Prometheus: Time-series database container that scrapes `/metrics` endpoint
- Grafana: Visualization platform container connecting to Prometheus as data source
- Trading Bot App: Main Python application container running core services

**File Locations** [Source: docker-compose.yml]:
- Grafana configuration: `docker/grafana/grafana.ini`
- Dashboard storage: `docker/grafana/dashboards/`
- Prometheus configuration: `docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- Main application: `grodtd/app.py` and `grodtd/web_app.py`

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/monitoring-observability.md]:
- Real-time data updates with configurable refresh intervals
- Dashboard performance optimization for responsive visualization
- Efficient data querying from Prometheus time-series database

**Integration Requirements** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]:
- Docker containerized deployment with Prometheus and Grafana
- SQLite database integration for historical metrics storage
- Real-time data streaming for live metrics updates

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location**: `tests/unit/test_monitoring/` and `tests/integration/test_monitoring/`
**Test Standards**: Unit tests for dashboard configuration, integration tests for Grafana functionality
**Testing Frameworks**: pytest for unit testing, requests for endpoint testing
**Specific Requirements**: Dashboard configuration tests, Grafana integration tests, access control tests
