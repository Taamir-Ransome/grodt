# Story 3.1.3: Environment Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system operator,
**I want** different environment configurations (development, staging, production) to support the full deployment lifecycle,
**so that** I can safely deploy, test, and manage the trading system across different environments with appropriate configurations, security, and resource allocation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Separate configurations for dev/staging/prod environments
2. Environment-specific secrets management
3. Database configurations for each environment
4. API endpoint configurations per environment
5. Logging levels appropriate for each environment
6. Resource limits and scaling configurations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 3.1.2 (Docker Compose Orchestration), the system already has basic Docker Compose orchestration with Prometheus and Grafana services. The existing configuration includes environment variables and basic service configuration. This story builds upon that foundation to create comprehensive environment management across the deployment lifecycle.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - focuses on environment configuration management.

### API Specifications
**Environment-Specific API Configurations:**
- **Development**: Local endpoints with debug mode, verbose logging
- **Staging**: Staging API endpoints with monitoring and testing capabilities
- **Production**: Production endpoints with security, rate limiting, and performance optimization

**API Security Configuration:**
- CORS settings per environment
- Rate limiting policies per environment
- Authentication requirements per environment
- SSL/TLS configuration per environment

### Component Specifications
**Environment Configuration Files:**
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment with debug settings
- `docker-compose.staging.yml` - Staging environment with production-like settings
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production environment with optimized settings
- `.env.dev`, `.env.staging`, `.env.prod` - Environment-specific variables

**Secrets Management:**
- Docker secrets for sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Environment-specific secret injection
- Secret rotation and validation
- Secure secret storage and access

**Database Configuration:**
- Development: SQLite with debug logging and verbose output
- Staging: SQLite with production-like settings and monitoring
- Production: SQLite with optimized settings and security

### File Locations
Based on the project structure, the following files will be created/modified:
- `docker/docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment configuration
- `docker/docker-compose.staging.yml` - Staging environment configuration
- `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production environment configuration
- `docker/.env.dev` - Development environment variables
- `docker/.env.staging` - Staging environment variables
- `docker/.env.prod` - Production environment variables
- `configs/environment/` - Environment-specific configuration directory
- `configs/environment/dev.yaml` - Development configuration
- `configs/environment/staging.yaml` - Staging configuration
- `configs/environment/prod.yaml` - Production configuration
- `scripts/environment-setup.sh` - Environment setup script
- `tests/integration/test_environment/` - Environment management tests

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location:** `tests/integration/test_environment/`

**Testing Standards:**
- Use pytest for all testing with async support
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use integration tests for environment validation
- Target >85% code coverage for environment management logic
- Test environment-specific configurations and deployments
- Validate secrets management and security

**Testing Frameworks:**
- pytest 7.4+ for testing framework
- pytest-asyncio for async testing support
- docker-compose for environment testing
- requests for API endpoint testing

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test environment configuration loading
- Validate secrets injection and security
- Test database configuration per environment
- Validate API endpoint configurations
- Test logging levels and formats
- Validate resource limits and scaling
- Test environment deployment and health checks

### Technical Constraints
**Environment Requirements:**
- Docker Compose 3.8+ for environment-specific configurations
- Docker secrets for secure secret management
- Environment variable validation and type checking
- Configuration inheritance and override capabilities

**Security Requirements:**
- Secure secret storage and injection
- Environment isolation and access control
- Secure configuration file handling
- Audit logging for environment changes

**Performance Requirements:**
