# Story 3.1.4: Health Checks & Probes

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system operator,
**I want** comprehensive health checks to monitor system status and enable automated recovery,
**so that** I can ensure system reliability, detect failures early, and maintain high availability of the trading system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Liveness probes detect when services need restart
2. Readiness probes ensure services are ready to accept traffic
3. Health check endpoints return detailed status information
4. Automated restart policies for failed services
5. Health check metrics are exposed for monitoring
6. Health check failures trigger appropriate alerts

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 3.1.3 (Environment Management), the system has environment-specific configurations and Docker Compose orchestration. The existing health check implementation in `grodtd/web_app.py` provides basic `/health` and `/ready` endpoints. This story builds upon that foundation to create comprehensive health monitoring and automated recovery.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - focuses on health check infrastructure and monitoring.

### API Specifications
**Existing Health Check Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Basic health check with database and metrics validation
- `/ready` - Readiness probe for container orchestration
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint

**Enhanced Health Check Requirements:**
- **Liveness Probes**: Detect when services need restart
- **Readiness Probes**: Ensure services are ready to accept traffic
- **Detailed Status**: Comprehensive system status information
- **Resource Monitoring**: Memory, CPU, disk usage checks
- **Service Dependencies**: Database, API, and external service checks

### Component Specifications
**Health Check Components:**
- **Application Health**: GRODT application status and performance
- **Database Health**: SQLite connectivity and performance
- **Metrics Health**: Prometheus metrics collection status
- **Alerting Health**: Alert system operational status
- **Resource Health**: System resource usage and limits

**Probe Types:**
- **Liveness Probes**: Detect service failures requiring restart
- **Readiness Probes**: Validate service readiness for traffic
- **Startup Probes**: Validate service startup completion
- **Custom Probes**: Service-specific health validations

### File Locations
Based on the project structure, the following files will be created/modified:
- `grodtd/monitoring/health_checker.py` - Centralized health check service
- `grodtd/monitoring/probe_manager.py` - Probe management and orchestration
- `grodtd/monitoring/health_metrics.py` - Health check metrics collection
