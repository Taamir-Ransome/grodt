# Story 3.1.2: Docker Compose Orchestration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system operator,
**I want** Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple services (GRODT, Prometheus, Grafana) for complete system deployment,
**so that** I can deploy and manage the entire trading system as a cohesive unit with proper service dependencies, networking, and data persistence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Docker Compose manages all system services
2. Service dependencies are properly configured
3. Network isolation between services
4. Volume management for persistent data
5. Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)
6. Service scaling and load balancing support

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 3.1.1 (Docker Containerization), the GRODT application is already containerized with a multi-stage Dockerfile, security best practices, and health checks. The existing Docker Compose configuration includes basic orchestration with Prometheus and Grafana services. This story builds upon that foundation to create a comprehensive orchestration system.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - focuses on orchestration infrastructure.

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints required for this story - focuses on container orchestration.

### Component Specifications
**Docker Compose Services:**
- **grodt**: Main application service with enhanced configuration
- **prometheus**: Metrics collection service with persistent storage
- **grafana**: Visualization service with dashboard provisioning
- **Additional services**: Database, cache, or other supporting services as needed

**Network Configuration:**
- Custom bridge network for service isolation
- Internal service communication
- External port exposure for web interfaces

**Volume Management:**
- Persistent volumes for database storage
- Configuration volume mounts
- Log volume management
