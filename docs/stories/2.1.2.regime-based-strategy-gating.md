### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Gating decisions must be <10ms to avoid trading latency [Source: docs/architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md]
- **Reliability**: Fallback behavior required when regime classification is uncertain [Source: docs/prd-phase2/product-requirements-user-stories.md#story-212]
- **Modularity**: Gating service must be decoupled from specific strategies [Source: docs/architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md]
- **Configuration**: Manual override capability required for operational flexibility [Source: docs/prd-phase2/product-requirements-user-stories.md#story-212]

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Test gating logic for each regime type and strategy combination
- **Integration Tests**: Test with real `RegimeStateService` integration
- **Fallback Tests**: Test behavior when regime is uncertain or stale
- **Override Tests**: Test manual override functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Measure gating decision latency (<10ms requirement)
- **Test Location**: `tests/unit/test_strategy_gating_service.py`, `tests/integration/test_regime_strategy_integration.py`

### Project Structure Notes
- **No structural conflicts identified** - The gating service fits naturally into the existing execution architecture
- **Integration Points**: Clear integration with existing `StrategyManager` and `RegimeStateService`
- **Configuration**: Follows existing pattern of YAML configuration files in `configs/` directory

## Testing
