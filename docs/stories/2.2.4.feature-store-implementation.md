## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2.3 (Data Retention & Cleanup):
- Comprehensive data retention system with automated cleanup is implemented
- Storage monitoring and performance optimization is available
- Data integrity verification and consistency validation is working
- All test cases passing with excellent code quality
- Storage architecture provides foundation for feature store implementation

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#database-schema]
- **feature_store**: Cache for precomputed technical indicators (id, symbol, timestamp, indicator_type, value, parameters, computed_at)
- **regime_features**: Regime-specific features (id, symbol, timestamp, feature_type, value, regime_class, computed_at)
- **feature_metadata**: Tracking computation parameters and versions (id, feature_type, parameters, version, created_at)
- **existing tables**: trades, orders, positions, equity_curve, market_data (for foreign key relationships)

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#data-backup]
- Feature store should integrate with existing SQLite database architecture
- Real-time feature updates should work with existing data flow
- Feature retrieval should be optimized for trading performance
- Feature consistency validation should ensure data integrity

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/system-overview-logical-architecture.md]
- **Data Layer**: Responsible for ingesting, storing, and providing market data. Writes to and reads from local SQLite database
- **Indicator Library**: Collection of reusable technical analysis functions (VWAP, EMA, ATR, etc.) in `grodtd/features/indicators.py`
- **Feature Store Integration**: Should extend existing data layer and integrate with indicator library

### File Locations
Based on current project structure:
- **Feature Store Core**: `grodtd/storage/feature_store.py` (new file to create)
- **Feature Store API**: `grodtd/storage/feature_api.py` (new file to create)
- **Regime Features**: `grodtd/features/regime_features.py` (new file to create)
- **Feature Store Tests**: `tests/unit/test_feature_store.py` (new file to create)
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/test_feature_store_system.py` (new file to create)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md]
- **Reliability**: System must be resilient to failures, including feature computation failures and cache inconsistencies
- **Performance**: System must provide fast feature retrieval during trading operations
- **Testability**: Architecture supports comprehensive testing, from unit tests to end-to-end validation
- **Modularity**: Components are decoupled, allowing for independent development, testing, and replacement

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md#testability]
- Comprehensive testing from unit tests of individual components to end-to-end validation
- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_feature_store.py` and `tests/integration/test_feature_store_system.py`
- Testing frameworks: pytest (existing project standard)
- Test patterns: Unit tests for individual components, integration tests for feature store workflows
- Specific testing requirements:
  - Feature computation accuracy testing
  - Feature cache consistency testing
  - Performance testing for feature retrieval
  - Regime feature computation testing
  - Feature store monitoring and alerting testing

### Project Structure Notes
- Current storage implementation in `grodtd/storage/` provides data loading, backup management, and interfaces
- Feature store should extend existing storage architecture
- Integration with existing `grodtd/features/indicators.py` for technical indicator calculations
- Docker volume for SQLite DB ensures data persistence across container restarts
- Feature store should work with existing Docker deployment architecture

## Testing
- **Test File Location**: `tests/unit/test_feature_store.py` and `tests/integration/test_feature_store_system.py`
- **Test Standards**: pytest framework with comprehensive coverage
- **Testing Frameworks**: pytest (existing project standard)
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit tests for feature store components
  - Integration tests for feature computation and caching workflows
  - Feature consistency testing between live and cached calculations
