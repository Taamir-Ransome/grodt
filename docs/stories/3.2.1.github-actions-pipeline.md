# Story 3.2.1: GitHub Actions Pipeline

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and enable reliable deployments,
**so that** I can maintain high code standards, catch issues early, and deploy with confidence across all environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated testing on every pull request
2. Automated builds and deployments on main branch
3. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
4. Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
5. Automated testing across multiple Python versions
6. Deployment to staging and production environments

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From story 3.1.4 (Health Checks & Probes), the system has comprehensive health monitoring and automated recovery capabilities. The existing Makefile provides build and test commands that can be integrated into GitHub Actions workflows. This story builds upon that foundation to create automated CI/CD pipelines.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - focuses on CI/CD pipeline infrastructure.

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints required for this story - focuses on automated build and deployment processes.

### Component Specifications
**GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- **CI Workflow**: Automated testing, linting, and quality checks
- **CD Workflow**: Automated builds, security scanning, and deployments
- **Security Workflow**: Vulnerability scanning and security validation
- **Release Workflow**: Automated versioning and release management

**Build Components:**
- **Docker Build**: Multi-stage container builds with optimization
- **Python Testing**: Multi-version testing with coverage reporting
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting, formatting, and type checking
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency and container security validation

### File Locations
Based on the project structure, the following files will be created/modified:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration workflow
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - Continuous deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Security scanning workflow
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release automation workflow
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Automated dependency updates
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Code ownership configuration
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - Pull request template
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Issue templates
- `scripts/ci/` - CI/CD utility scripts
- `tests/integration/test_ci/` - CI/CD pipeline tests

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location:** `tests/integration/test_ci/`

**Testing Standards:**
- Use pytest for all testing with async support
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Integration tests for CI/CD pipeline validation
- Target >85% code coverage for CI/CD logic
- Test workflow execution and validation
