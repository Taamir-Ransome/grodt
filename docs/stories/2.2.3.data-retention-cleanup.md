## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2.2 (Parquet Backup System):
- Comprehensive backup system with automated scheduling is already implemented
- Backup integrity verification with checksums and data validation is available
- Configurable retention policies for backup files are working
- Storage space monitoring and alerting is functional
- All test cases passing (25/25) with 100% success rate
- Backup system provides foundation for data retention and cleanup

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#database-schema]
- **trades**: Records every filled trade (id, timestamp, symbol, side, price, quantity) - CRITICAL DATA
- **orders**: Tracks the lifecycle of every order (id, client_order_id, status, symbol, quantity, submit_timestamp, fill_timestamp) - CRITICAL DATA
- **positions**: Maintains the current portfolio positions (symbol, quantity, average_entry_price) - CRITICAL DATA
- **equity_curve**: Stores a timeseries of portfolio value for performance tracking (timestamp, portfolio_value) - IMPORTANT DATA
- **market_data**: OHLCV data for technical analysis - OPERATIONAL DATA

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#data-backup]
- Data retention system should integrate with existing backup system
- Cleanup operations should preserve data integrity
- Storage monitoring should track both live data and backup data
- Retention policies should work with Parquet backup format

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/system-overview-logical-architecture.md]
- **Data Layer**: Responsible for ingesting, storing, and providing market data. Writes to and reads from local SQLite database
- **Storage Components**: Current storage implementation in `grodtd/storage/` includes data_loader.py, backup_manager.py, and interfaces.py
- **Retention Integration**: Retention system should integrate with existing data layer and backup components

### File Locations
Based on current project structure:
- **Retention Manager**: `grodtd/storage/retention_manager.py` (new file to create)
- **Retention Configuration**: `configs/retention.yaml` (new file to create)
- **Retention CLI**: `grodtd/storage/retention_cli.py` (new file to create)
- **Retention Tests**: `tests/unit/test_retention_manager.py` (new file to create)
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/test_retention_system.py` (new file to create)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md]
- **Reliability**: System must be resilient to failures, including cleanup failures and data corruption
- **Performance**: System must handle large datasets efficiently during cleanup operations
- **Testability**: Architecture supports comprehensive testing, from unit tests to end-to-end validation
- **Modularity**: Components are decoupled, allowing for independent development, testing, and replacement

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/architectural-goals-constraints.md#testability]
- Comprehensive testing from unit tests of individual components to end-to-end validation
- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_retention_manager.py` and `tests/integration/test_retention_system.py`
- Testing frameworks: pytest (existing project standard)
- Test patterns: Unit tests for individual components, integration tests for retention workflows
- Specific testing requirements:
  - Retention policy testing with different data types
  - Cleanup operation testing with various scenarios
  - Storage monitoring testing with different data volumes
  - Data integrity testing during cleanup operations
  - Performance testing for large dataset cleanup

### Project Structure Notes
- Current storage implementation in `grodtd/storage/` provides data loading, backup management, and interfaces
- Retention system should extend existing storage architecture
- Docker volume for SQLite DB ensures data persistence across container restarts
- Retention system should work with existing Docker deployment architecture
- Integration with existing backup system for comprehensive data lifecycle management

## Testing
- **Test File Location**: `tests/unit/test_retention_manager.py` and `tests/integration/test_retention_system.py`
- **Test Standards**: pytest framework with comprehensive coverage
- **Testing Frameworks**: pytest (existing project standard)
- **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  - Unit tests for retention manager components
  - Integration tests for retention and cleanup workflows
  - Retention policy testing with different data types
  - Storage monitoring testing with various data volumes
  - Data integrity testing during cleanup operations
  - Performance testing for large dataset cleanup
  - Cleanup operation logging and audit testing
