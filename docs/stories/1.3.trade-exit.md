# Story 1.3: Trade Exit (Take Profit & Stop Loss)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** trading strategy,
**I want** to place bracket orders (Take Profit and Stop Loss) immediately after a position is opened to manage risk,
**so that** I can automatically exit positions with predefined risk/reward ratios and stop loss levels based on ATR

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Take Profit (TP) order is placed at a configurable risk/reward ratio (e.g., 1.5:1).
2. A Stop Loss (SL) order is placed based on the Average True Range (ATR) at the time of entry.
3. The execution engine successfully emulates OCO/bracket functionality.
4. Bracket orders are automatically placed immediately after entry order fills.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- Trade entry is working with TradeEntryService, TradeSignalService, and ExecutionEngine
- All trade entry logic is implemented and tested (57 tests, 100% pass rate)
- Execution engine has order state machine and monitoring capabilities
- Risk management system is integrated for position sizing and ATR calculations
- The system can place market buy/sell orders and track their lifecycle

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-architecture.md#database-schema]
- orders table: Tracks order lifecycle (id, client_order_id, status, symbol, quantity, submit_timestamp, fill_timestamp)
- positions table: Maintains current portfolio positions (symbol, quantity, average_entry_price)
- trades table: Records every filled trade (id, timestamp, symbol, side, price, quantity)

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/component-deep-dive.md#execution-engine]
- Execution Engine: Features a finite state machine for order tracking (NEW → ACK → PARTIAL → FILLED / CANCELED)
- The bracket emulation logic listens for a fill confirmation of an entry order and immediately submits the corresponding Take Profit and Stop Loss orders
- Order state transitions: NEW → ACKNOWLEDGED → PARTIAL_FILLED → FILLED / CANCELLED / REJECTED

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/component-deep-dive.md#execution-engine]
- Execution Engine: Acts on signals from the Strategy Engine, constructs and places orders, manages their lifecycle, and emulates complex order types like brackets
- Risk Management: Calculates position sizes based on the ATR-based stop distance and checks against global limits
- API Connectors: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff and handles API rate limits, uses clientOrderId scheme for idempotency

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- New service: `grodtd/execution/trade_exit_service.py`
- Enhanced execution engine: `grodtd/execution/engine.py`
- Risk management integration: `grodtd/risk/manager.py`
- Configuration: `configs/risk.yaml` (existing), new strategy config needed
- Tests: `tests/unit/test_trade_exit_service.py`, `tests/unit/test_bracket_orders.py`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/component-deep-dive.md#testing-strategy]
- Unit tests for bracket order creation and management
- Integration tests for OCO emulation logic
- Tests for ATR-based stop loss calculations
- Tests for risk/reward ratio calculations
- End-to-end tests for complete trade lifecycle (entry → bracket orders → exit)

### Testing Documentation
**IMPORTANT: Testing Setup Requirements**
- Use `uv` package manager for dependency management
- Run tests with: `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_trade_exit_service.py -v`
- Run bracket order tests with: `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_bracket_orders.py -v`
- All tests use async/await patterns and require proper mocking
- Test coverage includes error handling, edge cases, and integration scenarios

**Test Files Created:**
- `tests/unit/test_trade_exit_service.py` - 15+ test cases covering TradeExitService
- `tests/unit/test_bracket_orders.py` - 10+ test cases covering ExecutionEngine bracket functionality
- Comprehensive mocking of ExecutionEngine, RiskManager, and Order objects
- Integration tests for complete bracket order workflow

### Technical Constraints
[Source: configs/risk.yaml]
- Risk per trade: 0.75% of equity per trade
- ATR multiplier: 2.0 for stop distance calculation
- Max position size: 10% of equity max per position
- Daily loss cap: 3% of equity daily loss cap
- Max concurrent positions: 3

### Project Structure Notes
- Follow existing execution service pattern established in `trade_entry_service.py`
- Integrate with existing ExecutionEngine class and its state machine
- Use existing risk management system for ATR calculations
- Maintain consistency with existing order tracking and monitoring patterns
- Follow existing async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
