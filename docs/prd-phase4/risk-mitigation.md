# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks
- **ML Model Complexity**: Start with simple models, iterate and improve
- **Multi-Strategy Conflicts**: Implement proper isolation and conflict resolution
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor and optimize ML model performance
- **Model Accuracy**: Implement fallback mechanisms for poor predictions

## Timeline Risks
- **ML Development**: Allocate sufficient time for model development and testing
- **Integration Complexity**: Plan for comprehensive integration testing
- **Performance Optimization**: Allocate time for performance tuning

## Quality Risks
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and ML model validation
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review and approval
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date technical and ML documentation
- **Model Validation**: Regular model validation and performance monitoring
