Product Requirements Document: GRODT (Post-MVP)
Project: GRODT (Grow. Reinvest. Optimize. Dominate. Trade.)

Scope: Phases 2-4, from Adaptive Logic to Scalable AI.

Status: Draft

Author: John, Product Manager

Introduction
This document defines the product requirements for the evolution of GRODT beyond its initial MVP. It translates the strategic goals of the project roadmap into a set of actionable epics and user stories that will guide the development of the system's advanced, adaptive, and AI-driven capabilities.

Phase 2: The Adaptive Engine
Epic: Adaptive Logic & Dynamic Risk Control
Description: As the GRODT system, I need to understand the current market environment and dynamically adjust my trading behavior and risk exposure in real-time to protect capital and capitalize on favorable conditions.

User Stories:
Story: Market Regime Classification

As the system, I need to analyze volatility, momentum, and price action data to classify the current market regime as one of the following: Trending, Ranging, Transition, or High Volatility.

Acceptance Criteria:

The regime is updated every 5 minutes.

The current regime state (trending, ranging, etc.) is available to all strategy modules.

Regime classification logic is logged for analysis.

Story: The "Capital Thermostat"

As the Risk Brain, I need to monitor the equity curve and automatically reduce the global position size after a predefined number of consecutive losing trades or a specific percentage drawdown.

Acceptance Criteria:

Position size is reduced by a configurable percentage (e.g., 50%) after 3 consecutive losses.

Position size is restored to its default level after 2 consecutive winning trades.

All "thermostat" adjustments are logged with a clear reason.

Story: Advanced Kill-Switches

As the Risk Brain, I need to continuously monitor operational metrics and halt all new trading activity if critical thresholds are breached.

Acceptance Criteria:

Trading is paused if round-trip API latency exceeds 500ms.

Trading is paused if realized volatility of an asset exceeds its 95th percentile over the last 30 days.

Kill-switch activation sends a high-priority alert.

Phase 3: Signal & Intelligence Diversification
Epic: Multi-Strategy Execution & AI Optimization
Description: As GRODT, I need to run multiple, uncorrelated trading strategies simultaneously and use machine learning to dynamically allocate capital to the most effective strategy for the current market regime.

User Stories:
Story: Strategy Integration (S2 & S3)

As a developer, I need to implement and integrate two new strategies into the core engine: S2: Mean-reversion to VWAP and S3: Breakout on trend days.

Acceptance Criteria:

S2 is only activated when the market regime is Ranging.

S3 is only activated when the market regime is Trending.

Both strategies adhere to the common Strategy Interface.

Story: The ML Meta-Controller

As the system, I need to build a machine learning model (the "Meta-Controller") that tracks the real-time performance (Profit Factor, Win Rate, Sharpe Ratio) of all active strategies.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Meta-Controller maintains a performance score for each strategy.

The system dynamically allocates a higher percentage of capital to the strategy with the highest score.

Capital allocation is re-evaluated every hour.

Phase 4: Scalable Execution & Self-Tuning
Epic: Multi-Venue Execution & Reinforcement Learning
Description: As GRODT, I need to execute trades across multiple exchanges to find the best price and liquidity, while using reinforcement learning to continuously self-optimize my own parameters.

User Stories:
Story: Multi-Exchange Integration

As the Execution Engine, I need to connect to Binance and Coinbase Advanced APIs in addition to Robinhood.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system can fetch quotes from all three venues simultaneously.

When a trade signal is generated, the order is routed to the exchange with the lowest fees and best available liquidity for that asset.

Portfolio value is correctly aggregated across all exchanges.

Story: Reinforcement Learning Layer

As the Meta-Controller, I need to implement a reinforcement learning loop that experiments with and tunes the parameters of the active strategies (e.g., EMA periods, ATR multipliers).

Acceptance Criteria:

The system makes small, incremental adjustments to strategy parameters.

Adjustments that lead to improved performance are adopted, while those that degrade performance are discarded.

The learning process is continuous and runs in the live market.
