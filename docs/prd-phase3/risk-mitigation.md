# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks
- **Container Complexity**: Start with simple containerization, iterate
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement gradually with comprehensive testing
- **Backtesting Performance**: Optimize for performance and accuracy
- **Security**: Implement security scanning and best practices

## Timeline Risks
- **Parallel Development**: Epic 3.1 and 3.2 can be developed in parallel
- **Testing Time**: Allocate sufficient time for comprehensive testing
- **Integration Testing**: Plan for integration testing between epics

## Quality Risks
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review and approval
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date technical documentation
- **Security**: Regular security scanning and vulnerability assessment
