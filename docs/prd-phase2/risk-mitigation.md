# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks
- **Regime Classification Accuracy**: Start with simple rule-based approach, validate against historical data
- **Data Pipeline Performance**: Implement incremental updates and caching
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Design for minimal performance impact
- **Integration Complexity**: Build on existing architecture patterns

## Timeline Risks
- **Parallel Development**: Epic 2.1 and 2.2 can be developed in parallel
- **Testing Time**: Allocate sufficient time for comprehensive testing
- **Integration Testing**: Plan for integration testing between epics

## Quality Risks
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review and approval
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date technical documentation
