## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **Data Integrity Tests**: Validate OHLCV data relationships and calculations
- **Chaos Testing**: Simulate data feed failures and recovery
- **Accuracy Testing**: Compare calculations against known reference values
- **Load Testing**: High-frequency data updates to test performance

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **Memory Testing**: Long-running processes to detect memory leaks
- **Latency Testing**: Measure response times under various loads
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end data flow validation

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **Concurrency Testing**: Multiple threads updating indicators simultaneously
- **Security Testing**: API key handling and log sanitization
- **Precision Testing**: Edge cases with extreme values

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
