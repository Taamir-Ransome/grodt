## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Performance Impact on Trading Operations

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Real-time metrics collection in a high-frequency trading system introduces inherent latency risks
**Impact**: High - Any performance degradation could directly impact trading profitability and system reliability
**Mitigation**:

- Implement asynchronous metrics collection with dedicated thread pool
- Use sampling and aggregation to reduce collection frequency during high-load periods
- Add performance impact measurement and monitoring with < 1ms overhead requirement
- Implement circuit breakers to disable metrics collection during critical trading operations
- Use non-blocking data structures and lock-free algorithms where possible

**Testing Focus**: 
- Load testing with realistic trading scenarios and market data
- Performance regression tests comparing system with/without metrics
- Latency measurement during various market conditions
- Stress testing with high-frequency trading simulation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Performance Impact Testing**:
  - Load testing with realistic trading scenarios
  - Latency measurement during metrics collection
  - Performance regression tests
  - Stress testing with high-frequency trading simulation
  - Memory usage monitoring during extended operations

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Memory Management Testing**:
  - Memory leak detection tests with long-running scenarios
  - Garbage collection efficiency testing
  - Memory usage limits and cleanup validation
  - Object pooling effectiveness testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Integration Testing**:
  - End-to-end metrics collection testing
  - Database performance impact testing
  - Security testing for metrics endpoint
  - Monitoring system resilience testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **TECH-001**: Performance impact must be < 1ms overhead as specified
- **PERF-001**: No memory leaks detected in 24-hour continuous testing

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **PERF-002**: Database performance monitoring in place
- **DATA-001**: Metrics validation and consistency checks implemented
- **TECH-002**: Comprehensive integration testing completed

### Accepted Risks

- **SEC-001**: Low probability with proper endpoint security
- **OPS-001**: Acceptable with monitoring system redundancy

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - Trading operation latency with/without metrics collection
  - Memory usage trends and garbage collection efficiency
  - Database query performance impact
  - Metrics collection overhead measurement

- **Security Alerts**: 
  - Unauthorized access attempts to metrics endpoint
  - Sensitive data exposure in metrics output

- **Operational Metrics**:
  - Prometheus/Grafana container health
  - Metrics endpoint availability
  - Data consistency between live and cached metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Trading system performance requirements change
- New high-frequency trading strategies are added
- Database schema modifications affect metrics queries
- Security requirements for monitoring data change
- Memory usage patterns change significantly
- Integration with additional external systems

## Risk Mitigation Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Risk Mitigation (Before Development)
1. Design asynchronous metrics collection architecture
2. Implement performance impact measurement framework
3. Create circuit breaker pattern for metrics collection

### Phase 2: High Risk Mitigation (During Development)
1. Implement memory management best practices
2. Add comprehensive memory monitoring
3. Create memory leak detection tests

### Phase 3: Medium Risk Mitigation (During Testing)
1. Implement database performance monitoring
2. Add metrics data validation
3. Create integration testing framework

### Phase 4: Low Risk Mitigation (Before Deployment)

2. Add monitoring system redundancy
3. Create operational monitoring dashboards

## Quality Gate Recommendation

**Gate Status: CONCERNS** - Due to 1 critical risk (TECH-001) that requires immediate attention and mitigation before implementation can proceed safely.

**Required Actions Before Gate PASS**:
1. Implement and validate performance impact mitigation for TECH-001
2. Complete memory management implementation for PERF-001
3. Demonstrate < 1ms overhead requirement in performance testing
4. Complete comprehensive integration testing

**Risk Tolerance**: Medium - Acceptable with proper mitigation and monitoring
