## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Security Testing**: Automated vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, security configuration validation
- **Container Orchestration Testing**: Multi-container startup scenarios, failure recovery testing, health check validation
- **Test Data Requirements**: Production-like container configurations, security test vectors, failure simulation data

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Security Compliance Testing**: Non-root user validation, permission testing, security header verification
- **Performance Testing**: Container startup time, resource usage, image size optimization
- **Monitoring Integration Testing**: Log aggregation, health check endpoints, alerting validation

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Build Process Testing**: Multi-stage build validation, dependency management
- **Configuration Testing**: Docker Compose validation, environment variable testing
- **Regression Testing**: Existing functionality validation in containerized environment

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9): SEC-001, OPS-001
- High risks affecting security: SEC-002
- High risks affecting performance: PERF-001

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls: TECH-001, PERF-002
- Low risks with monitoring in place: OPS-003, DATA-001, OPS-004

### Accepted Risks

- BUS-001 (Deployment timeline delays): Documented with stakeholder approval
- OPS-005 (Documentation gaps): Accepted with post-deployment documentation sprint

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Security Metrics**: Vulnerability scan results, security compliance status
- **Performance Metrics**: Container startup time, resource utilization, image size
- **Operational Metrics**: Health check success rates, container restart frequency
- **Business Metrics**: Deployment success rate, service availability

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New security vulnerabilities discovered in base images
- Container orchestration architecture changes
- Performance requirements change
- New monitoring tools integrated
- Regulatory compliance requirements updated

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### SEC-001: Container Security Vulnerabilities
- **Preventive**: Automated security scanning, minimal base images, regular updates
- **Detective**: Continuous vulnerability monitoring, security alerts
- **Corrective**: Rapid patching procedures, incident response plan

### OPS-001: Container Startup Failures
- **Preventive**: Comprehensive health checks, proper error handling
- **Detective**: Startup monitoring, failure alerting
- **Corrective**: Automated rollback procedures, manual intervention protocols

### SEC-002: Non-root User Configuration
- **Preventive**: Security configuration validation, automated testing
