## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Accuracy Validation Tests**: Historical data backtesting across multiple market conditions
- **Confidence Scoring Tests**: Verify classification confidence levels
- **Edge Case Tests**: Extreme volatility, market crashes, low liquidity periods
- **Ensemble Model Tests**: Multiple classification approach validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Integration Tests**: VWAP, EMA, ATR calculator integration
- **Performance Tests**: 5-minute update cycle under load
- **Real-time Tests**: Feature calculation performance benchmarks

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Unit Tests**: All classification logic components
- **Configuration Tests**: Regime threshold validation
- **Logging Tests**: Classification decision logging

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **TECH-001**: Classification accuracy must achieve >80% on historical validation
- **TECH-002**: Integration must be seamless with existing indicator system
- **PERF-001**: 5-minute update cycle must not degrade system performance

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **TECH-003**: Deterministic behavior with comprehensive test coverage
- **PERF-002**: Real-time calculation with performance monitoring
- **DATA-001**: Data quality validation with fallback mechanisms

### Accepted Risks

- **TECH-004-006**: Low-impact technical risks with monitoring
- **DATA-002**: Data retention with documented compliance

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Classification Accuracy**: Track accuracy metrics over time
- **Performance Metrics**: 5-minute update cycle timing
- **Integration Health**: Indicator calculation success rates
- **Error Rates**: Classification failures and fallback usage

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Market conditions change significantly (crypto volatility patterns)
