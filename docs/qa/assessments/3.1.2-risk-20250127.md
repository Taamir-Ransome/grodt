Date: 2025-01-27
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 12
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 67/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Service Dependency Chain Failure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex dependency chains with multiple services (GRODT, Prometheus, Grafana) create multiple points of failure
**Impact**: High - Complete system failure if orchestration fails, trading system unavailable
**Mitigation**:

- Implement circuit breaker patterns between services
- Add comprehensive health checks with exponential backoff retry logic
- Create dependency visualization and real-time monitoring
- Implement graceful degradation when non-critical services fail
- Add service discovery with automatic failover capabilities

**Testing Focus**: Chaos engineering tests, dependency failure scenarios, service startup/shutdown sequences

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Chaos Engineering**: Random service failures, network partitions, resource exhaustion
- **Dependency Testing**: Service startup/shutdown sequences, health check validation
- **Recovery Testing**: System recovery from various failure modes, data consistency validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Security Testing**: Network isolation validation, access control testing, penetration testing
- **Deployment Testing**: Multi-environment deployment scenarios, rollback procedures
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Volume persistence validation, backup and recovery testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with multiple service instances, resource monitoring
- **Configuration Testing**: Environment-specific configuration validation, hot-reload testing
- **Integration Testing**: Service communication validation, data flow testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (TECH-001) - Service dependency chain failure
- High risks affecting security (SEC-001) and data (DATA-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- High operational risks (OPS-001) with comprehensive rollback procedures and monitoring
- Medium risks with monitoring and compensating controls in place

### Accepted Risks

- Low-impact performance risks (PERF-002) with monitoring
- Development complexity risks (TECH-004) with documentation

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Service Health**: All service health checks, dependency status, circuit breaker states
- **Network Security**: Unauthorized access attempts, network anomalies, port scanning detection
- **Performance Metrics**: Resource usage per service, response times, throughput, memory/CPU utilization
- **Data Integrity**: Volume health status, backup success rates, data consistency checks
- **Operational Metrics**: Deployment success rates, rollback frequency, service restart counts

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New services added to orchestration (database, cache, message queues)
- Network architecture changes (new networks, security policies)
- Security requirements change (compliance, audit requirements)
- Performance issues reported in production (resource constraints, bottlenecks)
- Data persistence requirements change (backup frequency, retention policies)
- Container orchestration platform changes (Docker Compose version updates)
