- High Risks: 3
- Medium Risks: 2
- Low Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 65/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: API Key Exposure Risk

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - API keys in environment variables can be exposed through logs, config dumps, or deployment issues
**Impact**: High - Compromised MailDiver/Telegram credentials could lead to spam, data breaches, and service abuse

**Mitigation**:
- Implement secure credential management with HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Add credential rotation procedures and monitoring
- Implement audit logging for credential access
- Use least-privilege access principles for API keys

**Testing Focus**: Security testing for credential handling, penetration testing of notification endpoints, audit log verification

### 2. TECH-001: Alert Storm Risk

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Cascading failures or misconfigured thresholds can trigger alert storms
**Impact**: High - System overload, notification fatigue, missed critical alerts

**Mitigation**:
- Implement circuit breakers and alert correlation
- Add intelligent throttling and rate limiting
- Create alert grouping and deduplication logic
- Implement alert escalation policies

**Testing Focus**: Load testing for alert storms, chaos engineering for failure scenarios, alert correlation testing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Security Testing**: API key handling, credential management, notification endpoint security
- **Load Testing**: Alert storm scenarios, system resilience under high alert volume
- **Chaos Engineering**: Failure scenarios, recovery testing, circuit breaker functionality

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Performance Testing**: Notification delivery under load, latency measurement
- **Data Integrity**: Alert history persistence, backup/recovery testing
- **Integration Testing**: External API reliability, fallback mechanisms

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Functional Testing**: Alert rule evaluation, notification delivery
- **Configuration Testing**: Threshold tuning, alert correlation
- **User Acceptance**: Alert management workflows, acknowledgment processes

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (SEC-001, TECH-001) must be mitigated
- API key security must be implemented with proper credential management
- Alert storm protection must be in place with circuit breakers

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- High risks (PERF-001, DATA-001, OPS-001) with monitoring and fallback procedures
- Implement alert correlation and intelligent throttling
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alert testing procedures

### Accepted Risks

- None identified - all risks require mitigation or monitoring

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Security Metrics**: API key access logs, credential rotation status
- **Performance Metrics**: Notification delivery latency, alert processing time
- **Operational Metrics**: Alert volume, false positive rates, acknowledgment rates
- **Data Metrics**: Alert history integrity, backup success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New notification channels are added
- Alert rule configuration changes significantly
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered in notification services
- Performance issues are reported with alert delivery
- External API dependencies change or are updated
