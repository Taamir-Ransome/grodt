    title: 'Real-time data processing reliability'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Implement data quality validation at ingestion'
      - 'Add circuit breakers for data feed failures'
      - 'Create fallback mechanisms for missing data'
    monitor:
      - 'Add performance monitoring for calculation latency'
      - 'Implement data quality metrics tracking'

# Quality Assessment Summary
quality_summary:
  overall_score: 75
  test_coverage: 71%
  code_quality: good
  architecture: solid
  documentation: comprehensive
  
# Key Concerns
concerns:
  - "High risk: Real-time data processing reliability needs robust error handling"
  - "High risk: Financial data accuracy requires comprehensive validation"
  - "Medium risk: Memory management in continuous processing needs monitoring"
  - "Medium risk: Performance under high-frequency updates needs testing"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Implement data quality validation at data ingestion points"
    - "Add circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms for data feed failures"
    - "Create comprehensive audit logging for all calculations"
  monitoring:
    - "Set up real-time data quality metrics"
    - "Implement performance monitoring for calculation latency"
    - "Add memory usage monitoring for long-running processes"
  testing:
    - "Conduct chaos testing with data feed interruptions"
    - "Perform load testing with high-frequency data updates"
    - "Validate calculation accuracy against reference implementations"

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  Story 1.1 shows solid implementation with comprehensive unit tests and good architecture.
  However, two high-risk areas require attention before production deployment:
  
  1. Real-time data processing reliability - Market data feeds can be unreliable,
     and incorrect trend signals could lead to trading losses.
  
  2. Financial data accuracy - Data corruption or API errors could result in
     incorrect calculations triggering wrong trades.
  
  The implementation demonstrates good engineering practices with modular design,
  comprehensive testing, and proper error handling. The concerns are primarily
  around operational reliability and data quality rather than fundamental
  implementation issues.
  
  Recommendation: Address the high-risk items with additional monitoring and
  validation before production deployment.
